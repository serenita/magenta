`test-pages` contains the html-pages used for testing and `tests` the results.

The `timer.html` page can be used to automatically test the loading time of the pages from different servers.

The `tests/test-parser.py` script can be used to convert the test results to csv files. It also generates a `total.csv` file containing the average results from all the tests it converted.
